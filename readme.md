# Indoor Localization Framework

## Introduction
This repository is a framework for Indoor Positioning with Machine Learning approach to achieve the smallest error rate possible. Based on a paper in [WiFi](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7275492) Indoor Positioning which introduced data collection using a Client-based fingerprinting method.

## Progress Reports

### 2023/06/30
Dataset loader has been created. Due to data unavailability as of now, preprocessing is delayed. The main goal for now is to load the data using pickling method and convert it into several pandas DataFrames.

### 2023/07/02
Started working on Deep AutoEncoder model to reduct the features of dataset.
